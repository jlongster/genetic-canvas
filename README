Genetic Canvas, by James Long

-----------------------------

The first thing you need to do is edit "lib/setting.scm" and specify
the filesystem path of the project by changing the `root' variable.
Other system settings can be customized within that file.  And then:

To build, simply type `make'.

To run, simple type `./main'.

You must be using OS X to use this program. You can also run it as a
bundle by typing `./run'. I can't get environment variables from the
Info.plist file working, but when I do, the standard `open Main.app'
will work.

-----------------------------

Other common make commands:

make - makes all scheme modules, the main program, and the Main.app bundle
make objects - just makes all the scheme modules
make clean-lib-objects - removes the program's scheme modules

Obsolete commands:

make test - tests the core
make test-engine - tests the engine library
make test-images - tests the images library
make pdf - compile pdf documentation
