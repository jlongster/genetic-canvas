To build, simply type `make'.

To run, simple type `./main'.

You must be using OS X to use this program. You can also run it as a
bundle by typing `open Main.app'.

make - makes all scheme modules, the main program, and the Main.app bundle
make objects - just makes all the scheme modules
make clean-lib-objects - removes the program's scheme modules
make test - tests the core
make test-engine - tests the engine library
